\begin{cvparagraph}
	I am a Data Scientist and Analyst with a strong foundation in machine learning, and data analysis. I hold a Master's degree in Computational Design from the University of Tehran, where my thesis involved generating 2D urban networks using Neural Networks, GANs, and image segmentation. I have hands-on experience as an Artificial Intelligence Specialist at Shenasa-ai, where I worked with AI models, Keras, TensorFlow, and Python for deep learning and computer vision tasks. As a Data Analyst Intern at Quera, I focused on machine learning, data visualization, and data crawling to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to uncover insights, improve decision-making, and solve real-world challenges.
